Usage:
	python .../IntegerPixelSharpness.py [source_filename] [-a] [-c <resolution>] [-d <scale>] [-D <resolution>] [-m <length>] [output_filename]
Help:
	Pixelises an image (or sequence) and can even upscale the result.
	Similar to the Mosaic function in Premiere Pro but more accurate.
Options:
	-a		Output image with alpha channel.
	-c		The first resolution to convert the image into.
			This is the important part where the image
			gets transformed into a lower resolution to
			remove the blurriness from a high-ish reolution
			image (or sequence) that's displaying low
			resolution content.
			Format is int + "x" + int. ie. 1280x720
			If omitted defaults to 424x240.
	-d		The second step where the image is upscaled
			using nearest neighbour to a certain scaling
			factor. -D cannot be used simutaneously with
			this or an error will return. If both are
			omitted then image will not be upscaled.
	-D		The second step where the image is upscaled
			using nearest neighbour to another resolution.
			-d cannot be used simutaneously with this or an
			error will return. If both are omitted then
			image will not be upscaled.
			Format is int + "x" + int. ie. 1280x720
	-m		Indicates that an image sequence should be
			rendered. The source_filename would be the
			first in the sequence and should have a file
			name like image00000.png. The amount of images
			in the sequence must also be specified.
